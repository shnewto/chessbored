# chessboard

a chess board with movable pieces.

![grey and white chess board, grey and white pieces each in their starting positions and a selection menu of each piece along the right edge of the board. below the board are white letters on a black background describing the positions on the board in FEN notation along with a note that you can click to copy the FEN description.](/img/board.png)
